# LearningMPI
A quite random list of MPI programs with emphasis on compatibility with modern C++ standard library tools (std::vector, etc.).

The simpliest examples are not from me, they mostly come from MPI documentation/tutorials.
__Example of my own are listed here after__

## Examples

## Compilation 
The configuration is done by CMake. The compilation is as straighforward as: 
1. `git clone https://github.com/RemiHelleboid/LearningMPI`
2. `cd LearningMPI && mkdir build && cd build`
3. cmake ..
4. make
